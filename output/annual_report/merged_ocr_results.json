It involves a set of procedures and processes that ensure that the university's programs and services meet the required quality standards. Quality assurance is a continuous process that involves identifying areas of improvement, implementing best practices, and measuring performance against established quality benchmarks. It involves the active participation of all university personnel, students, and other stakeholders, and requires a culture of continuous improvement and accountability.\n\nThe Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) of Higher Education Commission (HEC) established Quality Enhancement Cells (QECs) in the universities of Pakistan in a phase manner. In the first three phases QECs in 45 public sector universities were established by HEC from the year 2006 till 2010. Then, HEC expanded its scope to the private sector Universities and selected 15 private sector, W category (HEC's then ranking), universities. NUCES was in the list of the first phase (2009-2011) private sector universities. In this context, QEC at NUCES was established on June 11th, 2010.\n\n## Vision of QEC\n\nSupport the university's vision by adapting best practices suggested by accreditation bodies while conforming to the university policies.\n\n## Mission of QEC\n\nAdapt existing state-of-the-art higher education quality improvement strategies, while engaging with all stakeholders.\n\n## Objectives of QEC\n\n1. Enhancing the pedagogical skills of the instructors to achieve learning outcomes of curriculum and effectively engage with the students.\n2. Provide coaching related to the processes and procedures prescribed by the accreditation bodies, to the academic staff.\n3. To communicate and coordinate with all the stakeholders (students, instructors, staff, alumni, employers, subject experts, etc.) for feedback with the aim of improvement of education quality.\n4. Formulate analytical reports extracted from the received feedback from the stakeholders, i.e., surveys related to infrastructure, teacher evaluation, alumni, employer etc. and provide recommendations to the statutory bodies of the university.\n5. Promote automation of quality related processes to develop an effective, viable and sustainable ecosystem of quality assurance at the university.\n6. Ensuring the compliance of quality assurance procedures in accordance with the guidelines provided by HEC and accreditation councils.\n7. Provide assistance to academic departments to meet the expectations of accreditation bodies in terms of data gathering and reporting.",

These guidelines provide a robust framework for maintaining and enhancing the quality of higher education and research programs across the university.\n\nThe NUCES QA Policy is meticulously aligned with QAA's guidelines to ensure that the university consistently adheres to the highest quality standards. The policy not only defines the procedures and processes for maintaining academic excellence but also establishes mechanisms for continuous improvement to meet or exceed the expectations outlined by the HEC.\n\nIn addition to adhering to QAA and HEC guidelines, the QA Policy integrates NUCES' internal policies and regulations. By using HEC's directives as a foundational reference, NUCES continuously evolves its quality assurance framework, incorporating newly developed practices and innovations that enhance the effectiveness of its academic and administrative processes.\n\n## Development of Faculty Mentoring Policy\n\nAs part of its commitment to faculty development, the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (NUCES) has formalized its efforts through the development of a comprehensive Faculty Mentoring Policy. While NUCES has long facilitated faculty growth through participation in various opportunities and in-house training workshops, these efforts were previously informal. Recognizing the importance of structured initiatives, the university has introduced a dedicated Faculty Development Program to achieve more impactful and measurable outcomes.\n\nThe Faculty Development Program focuses on two key goals\n\n1. Faculty Mentoring Supporting newly hired and relatively junior faculty members in adapting to the academic environment and excelling in their roles.\n2. Faculty Training Providing professional development opportunities to enhance the knowledge, skills, and competencies of faculty members at all levels.\n\nThis initiative underscores NUCES' commitment to fostering a culture of excellence and continuous learning among its faculty, ensuring their growth aligns with the university's mission of academic and research distinction.\n\n## Development of Policy for Best University Teacher Award\n\nThe National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (NUCES) has introduced the Best Teacher Award to recognize outstanding faculty members and promote excellence in teaching. The award aims to motivate faculty to enhance their teaching practices and professional skills. It is open to all full-time faculty members, from Lecturer to Professor, and evaluations are conducted over an academic year (July-June) to ensure a thorough and fair process.",
