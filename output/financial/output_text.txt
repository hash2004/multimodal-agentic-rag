**Share Capital**

*   **Authorized:** 4,000,000,000 (2018 - 4,000,000,000) Ordinary stock units
*   **Issued and Fully Paid:** 3,750,000,000 (2018 - 3,750,000,000) Ordinary stock units at no par value
*   **Outstanding (Issued) shares:** 1,192,647 (2018) and 1,192,647 (2019)

**Preferred Shares**

*   Offer investors a fixed dividend.
*   It may not be paid annually.

Here is a structured summary of the financial information extracted from the document:

**Aspects of Equity**

**1. Contributed Surplus**

*   **Concept:** When shares are issued for more than their par value, the excess is recorded as contributed surplus.
*   **Example:**
    *   180,000 shares issued at 40¢ each, with a par value of 25¢ per share.
    *   Paid-up share capital: 180,000 x 25¢ = $45,000
    *   Contributed surplus: 180,000 x 15¢ = $27,000

**2. Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)**

*   **Definition:** Certain company gains and losses that are not always recorded through the income statement.
*   **Examples:** Unrealized gains and losses on investments and hedging instruments.

The document contains the title "Income statement" and mentions "PwC | Basic Understanding of a Company's Financials". This indicates that the document is related to the income statement of a company and is likely part of a larger document explaining company financials.

--- Page 17 ---
The Income Statement has 3 main sections:
*   Revenues
*   Expenses
*   Profit or Loss

--- Page 18 ---
Here's a summary of the information extracted from the OCR results, focusing on the structure of single-step and multi-step income statements:

**Single-Step Income Statement:**

*   **Revenue:** Includes Revenue (+) and Gains (+).
*   **Expenses:** Includes Cost of Goods Sold (-), Selling, General & Administrative (-), Losses (-), and Other Expenses.
*   **Net Income:** Calculated by subtracting total expenses from total revenue and then subtracting income taxes.

**Multi-Step Income Statement:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue (+).
*   **Cost of Goods Sold:** Deducted from revenue to arrive at Gross Profit.
*   **Operating Income:** Calculated after deducting Selling, General & Administrative expenses from Gross Profit.
*   **Other Income/Expenses:** Includes Gains (+), Losses (-), and Other Expenses (-).
*   **Pre-Tax Income:** Calculated before deducting income taxes.
*   **Net Income:** Calculated after deducting income taxes from pre-tax income.

**Key Difference:**

The multi-step income statement provides more detailed information by separating operating performance from other income and expenses, allowing for a better understanding of the company's core business profitability. The single-step income statement combines all revenues and gains, and all expenses and losses, into single categories, resulting in a simpler calculation of net income.

The document is a presentation from PwC titled "Basic Understanding of a Company's Financials". The current slide focuses on the "Cashflow statement".

--- Page 25 ---
Here is a structured summary of the cash flow statement information:

**Cash Flow Statement Overview:**

The cash flow statement demonstrates where cash is being generated and used in the business. It is broken down into three main activities:

*   **Operating Activities:** These activities relate to day-to-day business operations. They include revenues and expenses that have been collected and paid during the year. Depreciation and amortization are not included in this section.

*   **Investing Activities:** These activities relate to non-current assets that support the business, such as property, plant, and equipment, and business acquisitions.

*   **Financing Activities:** These activities relate to transactions regarding shares or debt. The company raises funds by either borrowing or issuing shares.

--- Page 26 ---
The document presents a high-level overview of the Statement of Cash Flows. It highlights that transactions are categorized by activity type: Operating, Investing, and Financing. The statement also shows the relationship between the opening cash balance, all cash transactions, and the closing cash balance.
---

--- Page 27 ---
The document outlines the differences between the direct and indirect methods of preparing the statement of cash flows.

**Direct Method:**

*   **Operating Activities:** Cash flows are calculated by summing up cash collected from customers, cash paid to suppliers, and cash paid to employees.
*   **Investing Activities:** Includes cash flows from the purchase of equipment and disposal of property.
*   **Financing Activities:** Includes cash flows from the issuance of shares and repayment of debt.
*   The direct method starts with cash transactions, separating cash received and cash paid.

**Indirect Method:**

*   **Operating Activities:** Starts with net income, then adjusts for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, and changes in working capital balances.
*   **Investing Activities:** Includes cash flows from the purchase of equipment and disposal of property.
*   **Financing Activities:** Includes cash flows from the issuance of shares and repayment of debt.
*   The indirect method starts with net income, and non-cash adjustments are added.

--- Page 28 ---
Here's a structured summary of the key elements in a cash flow statement, based on the provided OCR data:

**Key Elements in a Cash Flow Statement**

*   **Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:** Represents the operating 'lifeblood' of the business after paying necessary outgoings for financing and tax.

*   **Changes in Working Capital:** Shows whether the business is absorbing funds for working capital or releasing them. Trends may indicate either financial stress or loose control over working capital.

*   **PPE Investment:** Companies must invest in PPE to maintain their productive capacity. A downward trend may indicate a declining company. Identify the necessary sustainable level of expenditure.

*   **Financing Requirement/Surplus:** Shows whether internally generated funds are sufficient to cover investments made in fixed assets and businesses. Continuous deficits indicate that growth depends on regular injections of external finance.
