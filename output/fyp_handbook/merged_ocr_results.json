The Role of FYP Coordinators \n\nFor the smooth conduct of the FYP process, the FYP coordinators carry out all the underlying supporting activities and provide the basic working platform for the execution of the FYPs.\nThe FYP committee works on different activities throughout an FYP lifecycle. Following is the detailed description of the roles and responsibilities of the FYP committee at different stages of the FYP process.\n\n## Step 1: Registration of FYP-1 Groups\n\nThe eligible students have to form FYP groups. A student who has completed 100 credit hours is eligible to register in FYP-1. As per current policy, an FYP group must consist of either 2 or 3 members. A group size of 3 members is preferable. More than 3 members and an individual student are not allowed to register in an FYP. The registration of an FYP group requires the students in the group to provide the following information to an FYP coordinator:\ni. FYP title and a brief description of the FYP (1 or 2 paragraphs)\nii. FYP type (Development or R\\&D)\niii. Name of the Supervisor\niv. Information of the group members (names, roll numbers, CGPAs)\nv. Any special hardware requirements\nvi. UN SDG(s) targeted by the FYP\nvii. Mapping of the algorithms and technologies from core courses used in the FYP\nviii. Proof of registration on Flex (Print out from Flex)\n\nThe information is provided to an FYP coordinator using the FYP group registration form, which must be duly signed by the supervisor. The submitted forms are then processed by the FYP coordinators. They check the eligibility of the FYP-1 students",

A list of registered FYP-1's is produced by the end of the second week of a semester.\nNote: The registration of an FYP group with the FYP coordinators is different from registering the FYP as a course on Flex. All students starting their FYPs must register first on Flex. In case an FYP is not registered on Flex, the student is debarred from registering his/her FYP with the FYP coordinators.\n\n# Step 2: FYP Proposal Defense \n\nAll members of an FYP group must appear before a faculty panel to present their FYP proposal. The FYP coordinators provide the format and duration of the presentations. For organizing the FYP proposal defense, the FYP coordinators perform the following tasks.\ni. Formation of the faculty panels (on the basis of uniform distribution of the faculty expertise)\nii. Sharing the evaluation policy and guidelines with the students and faculty\niii. Scheduling of the FYP presentations\niv. Processing of the submitted forms and preparation of results\nv. Providing faculty feedback to the FYP groups and supervisors\nvi. Re-evaluation of the rejected FYPs (with new/revised ideas and same/new supervisors/groups)\n\n## Step 3: FYP-1 Mid-term Evaluation\n\nFYP groups submit the mid semester FYP-1 report (in soft form) to the FYP committee and deliver a presentation along with the demonstration of the work in front of faculty panels as scheduled by the FYP coordinators. The development process of the FYPs follows iterative model. The FYP coordinators communicate the required deliverables of this presentation to the students.\nFor this evaluation, the FYP coordinators are responsible for the following sequence of activities:",

The FYP coordinators are responsible for the following activities:\ni. Collection of Posters from the FYP groups and verification of poster formats (manually done for every FYP group). The posters are accepted only after the approval from the supervisors;\nii. Printing of the posters and their display in university (coordination with the university printer);\niii. Evaluation of the Posters;\niv. Processing of the submitted forms and preparation of results; and\nv. Dissemination of the faculty feedback to groups and supervisors.\nNote: Poster evaluation may be merged (held in parallel) with the Mid-term evaluation.\n\n## Step 5: Final FYP-1 Evaluation\n\nThe FYP groups present the work completed as part of FYP-1. The FYP-1 report is submitted to the FYP committee in soft form after the approval of the supervisors. The faculty panels grade the reports along with the presentation. The FYP report that is not approved by the supervisor may be rejected.\nThe FYP coordinators are responsible for:\ni.

Every submission is verified and accepted only after the approval of the supervisor. For grading, the standard university policy is followed. As per current policy, the minimum passing marks for an FYP student are $\\mathbf{5 0 \\%}$. In case of substantial difference of group members' performance reported/ verified by the FYP Supervisor, group members will be assigned grades based on their individual performances.\n\n## Step 7: Execution of FYP-2\n\nFYP-2 is centered on the \"job fair\" (previously called OpenHouse), where companies are invited to view the FYPs and to hold the interviews. The samples of the forms used for FYP-2 are given in the forms section. The FYP handbook contains the tasks to be completed by the students before the job fair evaluation.\n\n## Step 8-a: Pre-Job Fair Evaluation (FYP-2 Midterm Evaluation)\n\nA purpose of the pre-job fair evaluation is to determine whether the projects are ready to be presented to the industry professionals. The pre-job fair evaluation is held in the $7^{\\text {th }}$ week of FYP-2. Only the projects that clear the pre-job fair evaluation (or re-evaluation) are allowed to participate in the job fair.",

Once the students are registered on Flex, they become part of the FYP-1 process.\n\n### 5.1 An Agile and Iterative FYP Process\n\nThe main goal is to move away from the lengthy requirements and the design process and adopt a more balanced approach, especially as there is no implementation in FYP-1. The students are required to perform the complete cycles of requirements to analysis and design followed by the implementation in both FYP-1 and FYP-2. FYP-1 and FYP-2 are divided into iterations.\n\n### 5.2 FYP Iteration\n\nIteration is a unit of work. FYP-1 and FYP-2 are now composed of a number of iterations. The size and duration of an iteration are to be decided by the project supervisors.\n\nIn case of a development project, in every iteration, students pick a few use cases, expand and design them, followed by the implementation, before moving on to the next set of use cases. Students may use proxies and stubs where needed (for use case dependency). For every iteration, an FYP group should follow the standard analysis and design approach studied in the course work. Every iteration should result in a working product that can be demonstrated.\n\nIn case of an R\\&D-based project, in the first iteration, an FYP group designs the proposed mechanism/ heuristic/ algorithm/ protocol/ mathematical-model, etc. and in the remaining iterations, the group implements a part of the proposed mechanism/ heuristic/ algorithm/ protocol/ mathematicalmodel, etc. Excluding the first iteration, every remaining iteration should result in a working code that can be demonstrated.",

Students can also propose a project of their own, but faculty should formally approve the project. The students who are completing their degree in the next semester are eligible to register in FYP-1. This means that a student must have completed 100 credit hours prior to the registration. The Head, FAST School of Computing, can allow relaxation of 1 course. Additional relaxation of a second course may be allowed by the campus Director.\n\nA supervisor must be a full time faculty member and may be assisted by an external supervisor. The students who are taking FYP from an industry/ outside are required to have an internal supervisor from the faculty and they need to submit a three page (maximum) FYP proposal (whose requirements have been mentioned above) to the internal supervisor. An R\\&D-based FYP must include substantial programming effort.\n\nOnce an FYP is registered, no change in FYP, group, or supervisor is allowed without the approval of the FYP committee. A sample registration form is attached in the forms section.\n\n## Step 2: FYP Proposal Defense\n\nThe FYP-1 proposal defense is held within the first 2 weeks of the start of a semester and is used for vetting an FYP idea. All groups are allocated presentation times and they must appear to present their FYP proposals. The FYP coordinators provide the format and duration of the presentations. The FYP coordinators may create \"Faculty Panels\" to evaluate the FYPs.\n\nThe faculty panels make decisions related to the approval, reevaluation, or rejection of the FYPs. The FYP groups may be asked to modify their FYP scope, etc. In extreme case, a faculty",

For every group, the feedback provided by the faculty panel is shared with the groups and their supervisors. To preserve confidentiality, the comments are separately compiled and are forwarded without the names of the evaluators.\n\nThe steps 1 and 2 must be completed in the first 2 weeks of the semester. At the end of the $2^{\\text {nd }}$ week, the FYP coordinators circulate the list of approved projects. Every project is assigned to a faculty panel.\n\nThe approved projects are then assigned resources in the FYP lab. The FYP coordinators and the IT manager collectively oversee this allocation.\n\nNote: Requirements for any additional hardware or software must be clearly indicated to the FYP committee. An application duly approved by the supervisor must be submitted, containing the information such as availability and cost of the hardware/ software resource. Please note that the campus is not obliged to provide the required hardware/ software resource and such requests are considered on a case-to-case basis.\n\n# Step 3: FYP-1 Mid-Term Evaluation \n\nThe midterm evaluation is scheduled in the $8^{\\text {th }}$ week of a semester. The prime motivation behind this evaluation is to track the progress of the students and guide them in completing the remaining milestones. Hence, the primary focus of this evaluation is on the requirements and the design phase of FYP-1. FYP groups are required to submit the midterm report in soft form.\n\nIt is important to note that the number of use cases is not a measure for the quality of a project.

However, if the students have only 2-4 use cases (which is the case with some development FYPs), they should be prepared to explain what they have been spending their time on. Perhaps, they have done some implementation, studied some new algorithms, made comparisons, etc. In case of the development FYPs, the groups should have a working code to demonstrate the implemented iteration.\n\nIn case of the report of an R\\&D-based project, the students have to focus more on the introduction of the problem domain and the research problem along with the related work of at least 5 most relevant research items (book chapters, technical reports, conference or journal papers, magazine articles etc.). The research items must be chosen with the approval of the supervisor. The FYP group can include the works that are either completed or in progress in the selected area. It is considered important that the FYP group should clearly describe the comparison of the proposed approach (framework/ heuristic/ algorithm/ protocol/ mathematical-model) with the related works as well as the limitations of the proposed approach. The group can either devise the approach under the guidance of the supervisor or the approach may entirely be given by the supervisor. In both cases, the FYP group should include the approach in the report that is submitted for the midterm evaluation.\n\nFor the evaluations, every group is given around 10 minutes for the presentation. The students are required to present the major components of their midterm report along with the work distribution among them.\n\nNote: The midterm evaluation form is attached at the end of the handbook.\n\n# Step 4: FYP Poster Evaluation \n\nThe FYP Poster evaluation is held in the $8^{\\text {th }}$ week of the semester",

Students are expected to complete the iteration-2 deliverables (the exact number of iterations to be completed in FYP-1 depends on the supervisor, but it is recommended that there should at least be 2 iterations).\n\nEvery group submits the FYP-1 report and delivers a presentation and demonstration of the work done publicly in front of a faculty panel, as per the schedule announced by the FYP coordinators.

The detailed contents of the report are according to the requirements of an FYP and are decided by the supervisor and the group. The basic format and the guidelines for an FYP report is given at the end of this handbook. The report and the presentation are graded by the supervisor and the faculty panel.\n\n## Step 6. Preparation of FYP-1 Grade\n\nThe FYP coordinators prepare the FYP-1 result. The grades are released only after the submission of FYP-1 report (in soft form). Every submission is verified and it is accepted only after the approval of the supervisor.\n\nThe set of deliverables (described in Table 2 below) depends upon the nature of the project.

Posters are evaluated by the faculty panel. The following is a list of recommended poster guidelines:\n\n- Poster size must be 22.5 \" x 34.5 \".\n- The orientation of the poster should be Portrait.\n- Don't use too much text - just highlight your major points. Use bullets whenever possible.\n- Make sure that the font is large enough for people to see it from a meter away.\n- Illustrations and visualizations of concepts (maps, pictures, photos, design drawings, diagrams, tables, charts, graphs, \"screen captures\") look nice and can often say more than words.\n- Make sure you spell check! (Also, note that capitalized words are often skipped by most spell checkers.)\n- The top-left part may contain the title of the project, names of the group members and the Supervisor(s).\n- The top-right part may contain the Project Goals.\n- The bottom part may contain the Project Plan and the list of tentative deliverables for the final FYP-1 evaluation.\n- While staying within these guidelines, there is plenty of scope for individual creativity through the use of different fonts, colors, backgrounds, and graphics.\n- Do not include too much information. Too much text may obscure the main message of the poster. Limit the information to the key information, rely on answering questions, and on your project summary to get across the details.\n- Use graphics where appropriate.\n- The original Photoshop/Corel file of the poster should be submitted along with a jpeg image of the poster.",

Recommendations are your choices for strategies or tactics based on your conclusions. Quite often authors are tempted to speculate on outcomes that cannot be supported by the findings. Do not draw any conclusions or make any recommendations that your work cannot clearly support.\n\n## References\n\nThis section should list all existing information sources used in the FYP. It is important to allow the reader to see all of the sources used and enable the reader to further explore these sources to verify the information presented.\n\n## Appendix/ces\n\nThis section should include all supporting information from the project that was not included in the body of the report. You should include surveys, complex statistical calculations, certain detailed tables, and other such information in an appendix.
